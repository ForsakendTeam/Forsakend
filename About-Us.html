<p style="text-align:center"> The first part of the quote is trying to tell us that no matter what you're doing in your life, you are traveling on a journey. You are writing your book that is open and in a constant loop of writing processes

<p style="text-align:center"> The second part of the quote is simply stating that whilst you are writing your book every second of the day, make sure to not waste that time you are given because, at any moment, it can come to a standstill. It tells us to live life to the fullest without wasting any of it and taking the time we get for granted</p>

<h1> Deep dive </h1>
Let's take a deep dive into the FUTURE...

<hr> 

First, let's look into the key definition of the term "Future/ The Future"

<hr> 

<p>>> Time that is to be or come hereafter.</p>
<p>>> Something that will exist or happen in time to come:
The future is rooted in the past.</p>
<p>>> A condition, especially of success or failure, to come:
An oracle had predicted the mighty hero's tragic future.</p>
<p>>> Grammar.
> The future tense.
> Another future formation or construction.
> A form in the future, as He will come.</p>
<p>>> Usually fu·tures. speculative purchases or sales of commodities for future receipt or delivery.</p>

<p>>> That is to be or come hereafter:
future events; on some future day.</p>
<p>>> Pertaining to or connected with time to come:
one's future prospects; future plans.</p>
<p>>> Grammar. noting or pertaining to a tense or other verb formation or construction that refers to events or states in time to come.</p>

<hr> 
<p>The future is a term that can be used in a situation of almost any kind, you can use it to describe the past present, and what is yet to come. Most use it as a means of inspiration as we are doing here, to describe a development they aim to achieve after a set time "the future".</p>

<p>Setting goals in life is really helpful and is one key fundamental element in understanding the future... The future is defined by a series of actions taken by either yourself or another in your group but ultimately by yourself. So you planning your journey means you can choose your destiny in certain ways.</p>

    <p>Some may believe destiny is written already, some believe we write our destiny... We are humans, we have flaws and amazing features, WE write our book of the life we have taken. This book is always different from another no matter who they are, even if they're your twin, their book will ultimately be different so you should choose your path like the idea of focus.</p>

<hr class="new4">        
        
    <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;">Let's start with his name, his name is Ethan Leigh Payne, or his online name Behzinga. He is a YouTuber who is a part of the group of YouTubers known as The Sidemen.
        
    What is more unique about Ethan is the work he did to get to his position from the depths he was in at the beginning of his YouTube career with the "Sidemen".
        
        He recently did a documentary type video going through what he went to up till now and what he has achieved, this is where all the information is coming from, but from a view of his community rather than directly from him.
        
    Ethan had already started YouTube before joining the Sidemen and was already creating content with them before choosing to work on goals, not goals of his YouTubing, but rather goals of himself. Ethan was in a point of life where he wanted to stop living, at this moment... He was at an all-time low.
</p>  
        
<style>
<p style="clear: both;">   
hr.new4 {
  border: 1px solid red;
} 
</style>
<hr class="new4"> 
        
    <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;">Ethan had a life-changing moment in the midst of a time where he almost ended his book, he chose to get away from the thoughts of stopping as a whole and started to create goals for himself.
        
        He started pretty basic, he started opening up to his friends in the Sidemen which he rarely ever did before, he used to hide his emotions but had now started to let go of the chains that had bound him before, this was when his friends knew Ethan was changing for the better.
        
        Over time, Ethan got used to the idea of working on himself and started going to the Gym, this allowed him to express his emotions in a method that wasn't coping up and hiding in an emotional barricade. This is probably what helped Ethan get to where he is now as it went off from this.
        
        Ethan increased his routines of Gym gradually to a point where we as the fans could tell how much he has changed emotionally and physically, he started to even rep the brand "Gym shark" because of his appearance and his journey he took to get to where he is now.
</p>
        
            <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;">Ethan weighed over 100kg during 2018 and surprisingly lost over 25 kg in weight due to his intensive gym routines which just showed how much he was dedicated to work on himself and change for the better for the sake of his future and his friends.
        
        Ethan was also then able to run in his own marathon "London Marathon", despite all the situations that had occurred with Covid, he was still in the mindset to continue with this marathon and did it after training intensively as seen in the images before this button.
        
        Ethan did daily 2k+ runs and even trained in different aspects to attack the roots of his body, from running distances to maintaining energy and stamina, to strength and agility. Ethan worked with a range of large athletes and friends to train for this marathon just so he could be at his peak performance for the marathon and not fail, he even trained with one of the world’s strongest men in the world to pull a fire truck which was phenomenal!

                Ethan is a person who has chosen to sort out himself and has never backed down despite the odds that have been stacked against him, including the fact he got Covid during his last few periods before his London Marathon, but this did not stop him, NO he carried on pushing and eventually completed the Marathon in record time!</p>

<h1> Deep dive </h1>
Let's take a deep dive into Optimism!

<hr> 

First, let's look into the key definition of the term "Being optimistic"

<hr> 
    
<p>>> Disposed to take a favorable view of events or conditions and to expect the most favorable outcome.</p>
<p>>> Reflecting a favorable view of events and conditions and the expectation of a positive outcome; demonstrating optimism:
an optimistic plan.</p>
<p>>> Of or relating to optimism.</p>     
    
<p>>> A disposition or tendency to look on the more favorable side of events or conditions and  to expect the most favorable outcome.</p>
<p>>> The belief that good ultimately predominates over evil in the world.</p>
<p>>> The belief that goodness pervades reality.</p>
<p>>> The doctrine that the existing world is the best of all possible worlds.</p>

<hr>
    
<p>Let's talk about being optimistic, there are many views one can look at this area, but to be optimistic is to think of the future whilst taking the challenge without fear of failure and when the chance of failure is high, one shall not back down from the challenge in play even when failure is assured because you must attempt the challenge as many times as it lies ahead because you may not ever get that opportunity again!</p>
    
<p>Being optimistic doesn't only involve yourself. When being optimistic, your journey will include many encounters, and those encounters may judge you or follow your journey but at the end of the day, they will learn from you in one form or another. One big detail they'll gain is being optimistic and that will take not only yourself far but also them so hold this term strong in your values because it will be something that will truly take you far in life when held up.</p>

<h1> Deep dive </h1>
Let's take a deep dive into Resilience!

<hr> 

First, let's look into the key definition of the term "Being Resilient"

<hr> 
    
<p>>> The ability to be happy, successful, etc. again after something difficult or bad has happened:
Trauma researchers emphasize the resilience of the human psyche.</p>  
 
<p>>> (Of a person or animal) Able to withstand or recover quickly from difficult conditions:
"babies are generally far more resilient than new parents realize"</p>    
    
<hr>

<p> There is not much to define the idea of Resilence besides the singular definition that links to humans and being able to overcome some sort of experience that has inflicted pain on typically that person alone but occasionally dwelling with others.</p>    

    <p> Another view on it is in the 2nd point referring to how children/babies are generally far more resilient, this idea that children are more determined to keep going is quite true and you should always be prepared to give more than you already are even when the path that lies ahead seems impossible.</p>

<h1> Deep dive </h1>
Let's take a deep dive into Success!

<hr> 

First, let's look into the key definition of the term "Being Successful"

<hr> 
    
    <p>>> The favorable or prosperous termination of attempts or endeavors; the accomplishment of one's goals.</p>
<p>>> The attainment of wealth, position, honors, or the like.</p>
<p>>> A performance or achievement that is marked by success, as by the attainment of honors:
The play was an instant success.</p>
<p>>> A person or thing that has had success, as measured by attainment of goals, wealth, etc.:
She was a great success on the talk show.</p>
<p>>> Obsolete. outcome:
A final product or end result; consequence; issue.
A conclusion reached through a process of logical thinking.
    </p>
<hr>
    
<p> Time to take a look into this word, as seen in the definitions of what it means to be successful, the images before this also show a good view on what it means to be successful but at the end of the day, we all stand together as a collective to stand strong. One is deemed successful to their own belief of where they are in life and what they have achieved.</p>
    
<p> In life, there will be those who judge you in a view where they compare you to someone else who may well be more successful to you but this should never bring you down, hold that to your side and look at what you have achieved, you've gone through x amount of time in your life during the struggles of life itself which is true success!</p>
    
<p> Although, yes there are levels of success that do include your position of roles or the income you make as that is definitive in stature which helps you get noticed therefore building up your connection but do not let this blind you, don't get confused between connections of success and wealth of success. These are these in my eyes that are completely different. Making connections lasts far longer than the materialistic items of money, so true success is your journey and those who you meet along the way!</p>

<h1> Deep dive </h1>
Let's take a deep dive into Adaptability!

<hr> 

First, let's look into the key definition of the term "Being Adaptable"

<hr> 
    
<p>>> Able or willing to change in order to suit different conditions:
The survivors in this life seem to be those who are adaptable to change.</p>
    
<hr>
    
<p>You will be faced with many challenges over time, some that may not appeal to you, it's your choice how you want to approach this path and go about it...</p>
    
<p>Time plays a major part in decisions as experience is key to many things in life, the older you get, the more you develop your inner thoughts and well being to a point where you have changed and molded throughout your lifetime/journey.</p>    
    
<p>Another way to view this is if you're training for a race like Ethan / Behzinga who adapted to what he once was and changed his life by working towards goals to succeed. He had the aim to run in the London Marathon and despite all the issues that sprouted up along the way, he adapted and overcame those issues, in which he succeeded and came out victorious!</p>

<p style="text-align:center"> Firstly, let's break down this quote into its respected targets or areas</p>         
      
<hr>

<p style="text-align:center"> The first part of the quote is trying to tell us that We should always be calm, we will have to face people or issues that may aggravate us but at the end of the day, we need to keep it together and not let those emotions get the best of us.</p>
  
<hr>        

<p style="text-align:center"> The second part of the quote states that whatever issue lies ahead, we should march on like a champion and not fall to the issue, because we are all strong whether we believe it or not.</p>        
  
<hr>        

<p style="text-align:center"> The third part of the quote tells us that we should basically welcome the new challenges that lie in front of us, and not run away from them. Rather than fearing for what is to come, engage with it, and let the curiosity of being a human flow through you and guide you to a better place.</p>  
    
<hr>        

<p style="text-align:center"> The fourth part of the quote tells us to be firm and be true to the challenges, don't let peer pressure guide you, let your thoughts guide you as that will be the best and most true option for anyone.</p>  
    
<hr>        

<p style="text-align:center"> The final part of the quote wraps the quote up by saying that once you can truly embody yourself, you will succeed in life whether you have ended up where you wanted or not.</p>

    <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;">Let me go ahead and explain to you someone who truly resembles what it means to embody themselves...</p>

</style>
<hr class="new4">        
        
    <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;">Let's start with his name, his name is Michael Ebenezer Kwadjo Omari Owuo Jr or his stage name Stormzy. He is a Rapper hip hop grime artist from Britain
        
    What makes Stormzy different from other rappers is his words, his use of politics and music to grab the attention of the Gen Z generation and constantly aim to teach them whilst also learning from them.
        
    On the 7th of January 2015, Stormzy came out strong at Number 3 in the BBC Radio 1 top 5, and soon after in March of 215, Stormzy released his single "Know Me From" which began to rise at an extraordinary rate to which it hit the UK Singles Charts and placed 49th.
        
    Soon after, Stormzy released his song "Shut Up" as a studio version which topped his previous single easily in which it hit number 18 in the UK charts dated the 24th of September. This became Stormzy's first top 40 as well as his first-ever freestyle to reach this height in the UK.
        
    Soon after at the end of the year, Stormzy performed his song "Shut Up" live at Anthony Joshua's fight with Dillian Whyte.   </p>  
        
    <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;">From this moment on, Stormzy grew to unimaginable heights to where he is now, he has performed in the Brit Awards and using Politics to guide his performance, and just before, he even performed a chant called "Oh, Jeremy Corbyn" with the backing track of Seven Nation Army at the Glastonbury Festival...   </p>

<hr class="new4"> 
        
    <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;">"Embody your beauty, Embody your talent, Embody your power... EMBODY it all, with this the world will never see your defeat!"</p>
<hr>    
    <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;">This quote truly resembles the type of person Stormzy is, he is someone that resembles everything that Forsakend wants to resemble and more.</p>
    
    <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;">There can be so much to say about Stormzy, his ambitions, his aspirations, what he has done and is still doing and so much more. Stormzy says what he does and impresses anyone who views him, his words inspire everyone and he inspires those who are from areas where they may not be in the best of positions in life.</p>    
    
    <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;">Furthermore, Stormzy holds his position as one of the key influencers along with side a few of the top artists both in the United Kingdom and the world. This is because of his style of rap that involves politics whilst also including meaning in all his lyrics. He constantly makes sure to include unique concepts that are always new and defining for a generation.</p>

<hr class="new4">  
        
        <p style="color:black;font-size:16px;">Stormzy truly resembles what it means to be an inspiration, and millions can agree with that. He is one of many unique people to hold such a unique position and with the rate Stormzy aims to grow, nothing will stop him.</p>

<h1> Deep dive </h1>
Let's take a deep dive into Noble!

<hr> 

First, let's look into the key definition of the term "Being Noble"

<hr> 
    
    <p>>> Having, showing, or coming from personal qualities that people admire (such as honesty, generosity, courage, etc.)</p>
    <p>>> Of, relating to, or belonging to the highest social class : of, relating to, or belonging to the nobility </p>
    <p>>> Impressive in size or appearance </p>
    
<hr>

<p> In any case, being noble in the traditional terms is what is shown in films and TV shows. This is when you show a certain stature such as a knight in an army or of some sorts but in terms of general humanity, being noble is far more than just the title you hold before your name...</p>
    
<p> To be noble is to true human features that relate to others in a way that makes that person happy.</p>  

<hr>
    
<p> The following words are the general views of what it means to be noble without the identity of a title being held in your face:</p>   
    
<p>> Honesty: To be truthful, honest, and upright about yourself and the people around you, do not throw shade around and expect their respect back. One should not lie to win but rather to show the truth in what is being said and thus will win.</p>    

<p>> Generosity: To be kind to another, generosity does not always mean giving money to another because money is only material, and can be spent just like that... To be kind is to help someone else whether it may be their well-being or their general day-to-day life. Anything to cheer someone up both in the current and future tense is an act of generosity. Don't get me wrong, donating money to people is a form of generosity but it depends on the situation at hand plus how that form of money is used.</p>    
    
<p>> Courage: When showing courage, this is having the mental or moral strength to do a task, may it be to confront someone or to complete a requirement that you may think you're not able to do. Things are difficult in life, to have the courage to overcome that fear of not being able to do something is a true sign of having courage.</p> 
    
<hr>
    
<p> Although another meaning of being Noble is to have good posture, size, or appearance... to truly be noble, it is what was explained to begin with. In the 21st century and going forward, size honestly means nothing when you show true nobility in your actions because people remember the actions you do over how you look...</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center">"For one to show true determination, one cannot be afraid of taking risks. Without risks, man would not be where we are today!"</h3>
<p style="text-align:center"> Firstly, let's break down this quote into its respected targets or areas</p>         
      
<hr>

<p style="text-align:center"> The first part of the quote is trying to tell us that we should not be afraid to take risks, risks can indeed have a downside but when the reasoning behind why you're taking the risk is valid and true, then there is a need to take that risk because, in the long term, it is far more useful than in the present.</p>
  
<hr>        

<p style="text-align:center"> The second part of the quote is stating that if risks were not taken during the lifetime of humans, we would truly not be where we are now so risks are normal. In the life of evolution, we have taken risks countless amounts of times so you taking a risk isn't something to fear, but rather something that may well change the course of your life for good.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"> Being determined in life is quite important, it's needed when facing challenges or just going about your daily life. You must show determination to get through your life and to succeed in life because ultimately, those who do not show determination do not succeed.</p>    
    
<hr>        

<p style="text-align:center"> Everyone is determined in life, to yourself and to show others. It's a part of our daily routines, to challenge what we think we can do, to exceed our limits.</p>

<h1> Deep dive </h1>
Let's take a deep dive into Determination!

<hr> 

First, let's look into the key definition of the term "Being Determined"

<hr> 

    <p>>> The quality that you show when you have decided to do something and you will not let anything stop you.
    <p>>> The act or an instance of making a decision
    <p>>> The condition of being determined; resoluteness
    <p>>> The act or an instance of ending an argument by the opinion or decision of an authority
    <p>>> The act or an instance of fixing or settling the quality, limit, position, etc, of something
    <p>>> A decision or opinion reached, rendered, or settled upon
    <p>>> A resolute movement towards some object or end</p>
    
<hr>

    <p> Determination goes a long way, the most general definition of being determined is the first statement above, it is the quality that someone shows when needing to decide on a situation that will not be altered by others decisions or let others sway you away from your goal.</p>
    
    <p> Although being determined doesn't only mean solving a task, there's so much more to it... TO be determined is to be able to resolve issues as well, for example, if you've argued with someone, you must have the determination to resolve that issue before it gets far deeper to a point where it will be lost from redemption.</p>
    <p> Above that, it's being able to show the truth to your actions and not alter your decisions based on what you don't truly understand or believe. Everything is connected and intern, your thoughts must be connected, if one branch of your thoughts is broken, then your decision is broken and your determination to that is therefore lost.</p>
